	  Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems 
	  which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component
	  of Sun Microsystems' Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).

	  The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the advancement
	  of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit 
	  various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for 
	  Mobile Applications.

	  The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. 
	  Java is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.
